I tried to also use a cluster finding algorithm (Hoshen-Kopelman),
available in the scipy library (scipy.ndimage.label) for the SW algorithm.

However, I ran into the issue that periodic boundary conditions aren't supported by this function.
So I tried to manually "fix" the boundary conditions, using the function find_clusters_periodic().

The idea was to use numpy matrix operations to do many of the operations all at once,
rather tham manually visiting each lattice site using a for loop.

However, the code turned out to be much slower than the above implementation.
Below I left my code for this alternative implementation.
